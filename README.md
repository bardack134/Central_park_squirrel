# Squirrel Color Counter

## Description
This Python project analyzes a dataset of squirrels in Central Park and creates a CSV file named "squirrel_count" containing information about the count of squirrels based on their fur color. The dataset is read using the pandas library, and the number of squirrels for each fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, and Black) is calculated and stored in the CSV file.

- Utilized the pandas library to read and manipulate CSV data efficiently.
- Implemented object-oriented programming principles to create a reusable and modular code structure.
- Calculated the count of squirrels for each fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, and Black).
- Created a CSV file containing the count of squirrels for further analysis or visualization.
